### Accessibility

I have worked hard to ensure the website is as easy to navigate and as accessible to disabled people as possible. To achieve this I:

- Used semantic HTML elements
- Added Aria tags to all links, buttons and content to ensure Screen Readers are able to comprehend it
- Used a San-Serif font for site navigation, to make it as easy to read as possible
- Used as little text as possible, to make sure the site is accessible to people who do not speak or read English
- Ensured contrasting colors were used throughout the site to keep elements easily idenitfiable and readable.

I also tested the site with the Chrome extension [Web Disability Simulator](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/web-disability-simulator/olioanlbgbpmdlgjnnampnnlohigkjla) to ensure the user experience was friendly to those with color blindness, parkinsons and dyslexia.
