Testing was ongoing throughout the entire build. I utilised Chrome developer tools whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

During development I made use of Google developer tools to ensure everything was working correctly and to assist with troubleshooting when things were not working as expected.

I have gone through each page using Google Chrome developer tools & Microsoft Edge inspector tool to ensure that each page is responsive on a variety of different screen sizes and devices.

## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

**HTML Validation**

I used [W3C's HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check my code.

**CSS Validation**

I used [W3C's Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to test my site's CSS.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.
